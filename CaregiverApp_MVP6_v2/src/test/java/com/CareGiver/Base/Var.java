Optimally, you will enter the time you spend caring for insureds in real time, that is, when you begin and end caring for the insured while you are at the insured’s residence.   For each date of service, you will Log In, enter the time spent caring for an insured and the type of care provided, and add it to a current invoice. You may also submit completed invoices through the App and view invoice histories. Further, if you care for more than one John Hancock insured, you will be able to enter time and the type of care provided, submit completed invoices, and view invoice history for each insured for whom you provide care. You will also be able to view the MyProfile Section where you may update your email address and phone number, as necessary.   The information you enter through the App will assist John Hancock in streamlining the invoicing and claims process, as well as validating and ensuring accuracy therein.Your Access In order to access this App, you must have previously registered in the LTC Provider Portal to create an account (“User Account”).
